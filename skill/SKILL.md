Two modes: 'test this' for targeted testing of specific changes, and 'test everything' for comprehensive project-wide test audits. Adapts to any test framework (Jest, Vitest, pytest, Go test, etc.)."

# Intelligent Test Generation & Execution

Two modes of operation based on user intent:

## Mode 1: "Test This" (Targeted)

Triggered when the user wants to test specific changes, a file, a function, or a feature.

### Step 1: Analyze Scope

Identify what changed or what needs testing. Do ALL of the following:

- **Read the target files/functions completely** — Don't skim. Read the entire file so you understand the full context, not just the function in question.
- **Map dependencies** — What does this module import? What imports this module? Trace the call chain both directions. This tells you what to mock and what integration points exist.
- **Identify the public interface** — What functions/classes are exported? These are what external code depends on, so these are what you test. Internal helpers get tested indirectly through the public API.
- **Catalog every code path** — For each function, identify:
  - The happy path (normal expected input → expected output)
  - Every `if/else` branch — what condition triggers each branch?
  - Every `try/catch` or error handling block — what errors can occur?
  - Every early return — what conditions cause the function to exit early?
  - Loop boundaries — what happens with 0 items? 1 item? Many items?
  - Null/undefined checks — what happens when optional values are missing?
  - Type coercions or transformations — what happens with unexpected types?
- **Note boundary values** — For numeric inputs: 0, -1, MAX_INT, NaN. For strings: empty string, very long string, strings with special characters (unicode, newlines, null bytes). For arrays: empty, single element, very large.
- **Check for side effects** — Does the function write to disk? Make network calls? Modify global state? Send events? Log messages? These are things you need to verify in tests.

### Step 2: Detect Test Infrastructure

Before writing a single line of test code, understand the existing test setup completely:

- **Find existing test files** — Search for ALL of these patterns:
  - `*.test.ts`, `*.test.js`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.test.jsx`
  - `*.spec.ts`, `*.spec.js`, `*.spec.tsx`, `*.spec.jsx`
  - `*_test.go`, `*_test.py`, `test_*.py`
  - `tests/` directories, `__tests__/` directories, `spec/` directories
- **Identify the framework** — Check these files in order:
  - `package.json` → look in `devDependencies` and `dependencies` for `jest`, `vitest`, `mocha`, `ava`, `tape`, `@testing-library/*`
  - `vitest.config.*` or `vite.config.*` (with test section) → Vitest
  - `jest.config.*` or `"jest"` key in package.json → Jest
  - `pyproject.toml` → look for `[tool.pytest]` section
  - `pytest.ini`, `setup.cfg` with `[tool:pytest]` → pytest
  - `go.mod` → Go testing
  - `Cargo.toml` → Rust testing
  - `mix.exs` → ExUnit
  - `Gemfile` with `rspec` → RSpec
- **Read the test config file** — Don't just detect the framework; read the full config. Look for:
  - Custom test environment (`jsdom`, `node`, `happy-dom`)
  - Global setup/teardown files
  - Module name mapping or path aliases
  - Coverage settings and thresholds
  - Custom matchers or extensions
  - Timeout settings
  - Transform configurations (Babel, SWC, etc.)
- **Study 2-3 existing test files** — Read them completely. Understand:
  - How are tests organized? (describe blocks? nested? flat?)
  - What assertion style? (`expect(x).toBe(y)` vs `assert.equal(x, y)` vs `x.should.equal(y)`)
  - How are fixtures set up? (beforeEach? factory functions? test helpers?)
  - How are mocks created? (jest.mock? vi.mock? manual stubs? dependency injection?)
  - What cleanup happens in afterEach/afterAll?
  - Are there shared test utilities? (look for `test/helpers`, `test/utils`, `test/fixtures`, `__mocks__/`)
- **Check the test runner script** — Look in:
  - `package.json` scripts: `"test"`, `"test:unit"`, `"test:integration"`, `"test:watch"`
  - `Makefile` targets
  - CI config (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) — what test commands does CI run?

### Step 3: Generate Test Plan

Before writing code, explicitly plan what you will test. This prevents gaps and redundant tests:

- **List every function/method that needs tests** — Be specific: "functionName in file.ts"
- **For each function, list the scenarios:**
  - Happy path with typical input
  - Empty/null/undefined input
  - Error conditions (what can go wrong?)
  - Boundary values (min, max, zero, one-off)
  - Concurrent/async edge cases (if applicable)
  - State-dependent behavior (if the function reads from a store, database, or context)
- **Decide what to mock vs test for real:**
  - MOCK: network calls, filesystem operations (usually), timers, randomness, external services, databases (in unit tests)
  - DON'T MOCK: the module you're testing, pure utility functions, in-memory data structures, state stores (test with real store)
  - REAL INTEGRATION TEST: when the interaction between two modules IS the thing being tested
- **Define expected assertions** — For each scenario, write down what you expect:
  - Return value (exact value, type, shape)
  - Side effects (was a function called? with what arguments? how many times?)
  - State changes (did the store/database/file change as expected?)
  - Errors thrown (correct error type? correct message? correct error code?)
  - Events emitted (correct event name? correct payload?)

### Step 4: Write Tests

Follow these rules precisely:

**Structure:**
```
describe("ModuleName", () => {
  describe("functionName", () => {
    it("does X when given Y", () => { ... })
    it("throws Z when given invalid input", () => { ... })
  })
})
```

**Naming conventions:**
- describe block: name of the module or class
- Nested describe: name of the function or method
- it/test: starts with a verb describing the behavior — "returns", "throws", "emits", "creates", "updates", "deletes", "calls", "ignores", "handles"
- Bad names: "test 1", "works", "correct behavior", "should work properly"
- Good names: "returns empty array when no items match filter", "throws InvalidTokenError when JWT is expired", "emits 'change' event with new value after setState"

**Test body pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
```
it("description", () => {
  // Arrange — set up inputs, mocks, state
  const input = createTestInput({ name: "test" })
  const mockDb = { query: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue([]) }

  // Act — call the thing being tested (ONE action)
  const result = await processInput(input, mockDb)

  // Assert — verify the outcome
  expect(result.status).toBe("success")
  expect(mockDb.query).toHaveBeenCalledWith("SELECT * FROM items WHERE name = ?", ["test"])
})
```

**Matching project style:**
- If existing tests use `test()`, use `test()`. If they use `it()`, use `it()`.
- If existing tests use factories like `createTestUser()`, use the same factories.
- If existing tests put mocks in `__mocks__/`, put yours there too.
- If existing tests use `beforeAll` for expensive setup, follow that pattern.
- NEVER introduce a new test utility library that isn't already in the project.

**Independence:**
- Each test must pass when run alone AND when run with all other tests in any order.
- Never rely on test execution order.
- Always clean up: if you create temp files, delete them in afterEach. If you modify global state, restore it.
- Use fresh instances/mocks in each test (setUp in beforeEach, not at module level).

**Determinism:**
- NO real network calls — mock fetch/axios/http
- NO real timers — use fake timers (vi.useFakeTimers / jest.useFakeTimers)
- NO real random values — mock Math.random or inject a seed
- NO real dates — mock Date.now() or use fake timers
- NO reading from real filesystem unless you control the content (use tmp dirs with known content)
- NO environment-dependent behavior without mocking process.env

### Step 5: Run and Iterate

After writing tests, execute them and fix issues:

1. **Run ONLY your new tests first** — Don't waste time running the full suite initially:
   - Vitest: `npx vitest run path/to/your.test.ts`
   - Jest: `npx jest path/to/your.test.ts`
   - pytest: `pytest path/to/your_test.py`
   - Go: `go test ./pkg/yourpkg/ -run TestYourFunction`
2. **If tests fail, diagnose:**
   - Is it a test bug? (wrong mock setup, wrong expected value, wrong import path) → Fix the test
   - Is it an actual code bug? (the function genuinely doesn't handle this case) → Report it clearly: "BUG FOUND: functionName in file.ts does not handle X case. Expected: Y. Actual: Z."
   - Is it an environment issue? (missing dependency, wrong Node version, permission error) → Report it and suggest a fix
3. **Run the FULL test suite** — After your tests pass in isolation:
   - This catches regressions — did you break something else?
   - This catches shared state issues — does your test interfere with existing tests?
4. **Report results clearly:**
   - "X new tests written across Y files"
   - "All Z tests passing (X new + Y existing)"
   - "Coverage: before A% → after B% (if coverage tool available)"
   - "Bugs found: [list any actual bugs discovered]"

---

## Mode 2: "Test Everything" (Comprehensive Audit)

Triggered when the user wants to improve overall test coverage or audit testing health.

### Step 1: Scan the Project

Build a complete testing inventory:

- **Map source → test files** — For every source file, determine if a corresponding test file exists:
  - `src/auth/login.ts` → `tests/auth/login.test.ts` or `src/auth/login.test.ts` or `src/auth/__tests__/login.test.ts`
  - Note which source files have NO corresponding test file
- **Count metrics:**
  - Total source files vs total test files
  - Test-to-source ratio (healthy projects: 0.8-1.5 test files per source file)
  - Lines of test code vs lines of source code
- **Check existing coverage** — Run coverage tool if available:
  - `npx vitest --coverage` or `npx jest --coverage` or `pytest --cov` or `go test -cover ./...`
  - Note: don't run this on huge projects without checking if it's configured first
- **Identify broken tests** — Look for:
  - Tests marked with `.skip`, `.todo`, `@pytest.mark.skip`, `t.Skip()`
  - Tests that are commented out
  - Test files that import non-existent modules (stale tests)
- **Check test infrastructure health:**
  - Is CI running tests? (check `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`)
  - Are there flaky tests? (check CI history for intermittent failures)
  - Is coverage tracking enabled? (check for `coveralls`, `codecov`, coverage config)

### Step 2: Prioritize by Risk

Not all code deserves equal testing effort. Prioritize by impact of bugs:

**CRITICAL — Test these first (bugs here = user-facing incidents, security vulnerabilities, data loss):**
- Authentication and authorization (login, session management, permission checks, token validation)
- Payment/billing logic (charge calculations, subscription management, refunds)
- Data mutations (database writes, file writes, state changes that persist)
- Public API endpoints (the contract external consumers depend on)
- Core business logic (the domain rules that define what the product does)
- Security-sensitive code (input validation, sanitization, encryption, CSRF protection)
- Data migrations and schema changes

**HIGH — Test next (bugs here = degraded experience, incorrect behavior):**
- Shared utility functions (used by many modules — a bug here multiplies)
- State management (stores, reducers, context — controls what users see)
- Data transformations (parsing, serialization, formatting — data integrity depends on these)
- Error handling paths (how does the system recover from failures?)
- Event systems (pub/sub, webhooks, callbacks — ordering and delivery matter)
- Caching logic (invalidation bugs are subtle and hard to diagnose)

**MEDIUM — Test when critical/high are covered:**
- UI components with logic (forms with validation, modals with state, filters)
- Configuration parsing (what happens with invalid config? missing fields?)
- CLI command handlers (argument parsing, output formatting)
- Background jobs and schedulers (do they run? do they retry on failure?)
- Logging and telemetry (are the right events emitted with the right data?)

**LOW — Test last (or skip unless specifically requested):**
- Pure UI rendering with no logic (styled components, layout containers)
- Generated code (protobuf stubs, GraphQL types, ORM models)
- Simple getters/setters with no logic
- Type-only files (interfaces, type aliases)
- Constants and configuration values
- Third-party library wrappers with no custom logic

### Step 3: Coverage Gap Analysis

For each module, identify what testing is MISSING:

- **Untested functions** — Functions with zero test coverage. Find by:
  - Reading the source file and checking if any test imports/calls each exported function
  - Running coverage and checking for 0% functions
- **Partial coverage** — Functions that have tests but miss important scenarios:
  - Only happy path tested (no error cases)
  - Only one input shape tested (what about empty? null? large?)
  - Only synchronous behavior tested (what about async/concurrent?)
  - Only success callbacks tested (what about failure callbacks?)
- **Missing integration tests** — Two modules work together but no test verifies their integration:
  - API handler → database queries (does the handler correctly translate request → query → response?)
  - Event emitter → event handler (does the handler receive and process events correctly?)
  - Auth middleware → route handler (does protected route correctly reject unauthorized requests?)
- **Environmental edge cases not tested:**
  - What happens when disk is full? (file write operations)
  - What happens when network is slow/down? (API calls, timeouts)
  - What happens when the database connection drops? (reconnection, transaction rollback)
  - What happens when env vars are missing? (startup, feature flags)

### Step 4: Generate Tests in Batches

Work systematically, not all at once:

1. **Batch by module** — One source file or one closely-related group at a time
2. **Start with the highest priority** — Critical items first
3. **Write, run, confirm** — After each batch:
   - Write the tests
   - Run them (just the new batch, not the full suite yet)
   - Fix any test bugs
   - Report: "Batch 1: auth module — 12 tests added, all passing"
4. **Ask before continuing** — If the total scope is more than 3-4 batches, ask the user: "Completed batch 1 (auth). Ready for batch 2 (state management)?"
5. **Full suite run after each batch** — Ensure no regressions

### Step 5: Summary Report

When finished, provide:

```
## Test Audit Results

**Tests added:** X new tests across Y files
**Coverage change:** A% → B% (or "coverage tool not configured")
**Full suite status:** Z/Z passing

### By priority:
- Critical: [list what was tested]
- High: [list what was tested]
- Remaining gaps: [list what still needs tests and why you skipped it]

### Bugs discovered:
- [BUG] description — file:line — expected X, got Y

### Recommendations:
- [any test infrastructure improvements suggested]
```

## Testing Terminal/CLI/TUI Applications

When testing terminal applications (Ink, Blessed, terminal-kit, raw ANSI, or any terminal UI), pay special attention to these concerns:

### Terminal Dimensions

Terminal apps behave differently based on terminal size. You MUST test:

- **Standard sizes:** 80x24 (classic default), 120x30 (modern default), 132x43 (wide)
- **Narrow terminals:** 40x24, 60x20 — Does the UI wrap? Does it truncate? Does it crash?
- **Very small terminals:** 20x10 — Does the app show an error message? Does it degrade gracefully?
- **Very large terminals:** 200x60 — Does content stretch? Are there alignment issues?
- **What to check at each size:**
  - Does text wrap correctly or get cut off?
  - Do columns/tables align properly?
  - Are progress bars the right width?
  - Do menu items fit without overflow?
  - Is there horizontal scrolling when needed?
  - Does the layout switch from multi-column to single-column at narrow widths?

**How to mock terminal size:**
```typescript
// Node.js
process.stdout.columns = 80
process.stdout.rows = 24
// or mock the TTY
vi.spyOn(process.stdout, 'columns', 'get').mockReturnValue(80)
vi.spyOn(process.stdout, 'rows', 'get').mockReturnValue(24)
```

### ANSI Output and Colors

- **Test with color disabled** — Set `NO_COLOR=1` or `FORCE_COLOR=0` and verify output is readable without ANSI codes
- **Test color output** — Verify correct ANSI sequences are emitted (use snapshot testing or strip-ansi for comparison)
- **Check that color codes don't break width calculations** — ANSI escape sequences are zero-width but naive `string.length` counts them

### Keyboard Input

- **Arrow keys** — Up, Down, Left, Right navigation
- **Enter/Return** — Selection/confirmation
- **Escape** — Cancel/back
- **Ctrl+C** — Graceful exit (not just process.kill)
- **Tab** — Focus switching between elements
- **Special sequences** — Home, End, Page Up, Page Down, Delete, Backspace
- **Rapid input** — What happens if the user types faster than the UI updates?
- **Paste** — Multi-character input in one event (especially with newlines)

### Terminal State Management

- **Cursor position** — Is it restored correctly after operations?
- **Alternate screen buffer** — If the app uses it (`\x1b[?1049h`), does it restore the original screen on exit?
- **Scroll regions** — Are they set up and torn down correctly?
- **Raw mode** — If the app enables raw mode, does it disable it on exit (including on crash/error)?
- **Signal handling** — SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGWINCH (terminal resize) — are they handled?

### Interactive Prompts

- **Default values** — Does pressing Enter without input use the default?
- **Validation** — Does invalid input show an error and re-prompt?
- **Autocomplete** — Does it filter correctly as the user types?
- **Multi-select** — Can items be selected/deselected? Is the selection state shown correctly?
- **Scrollable lists** — When there are more items than terminal height, does scrolling work?

---

## Testing Async/Concurrent Code

### Promises and async/await

- **Resolved path** — Does the function return the correct value?
- **Rejected path** — Does it throw/reject with the correct error?
- **Timeout** — What happens if the async operation takes too long?
- **Cancellation** — If the operation supports AbortController, does cancellation work?
- **Sequential vs parallel** — If multiple async operations happen, is the order correct?

### Race conditions

- **Concurrent writes** — What if two operations modify the same resource simultaneously?
- **Stale reads** — What if data changes between read and write?
- **Debounce/throttle** — Does the timing logic work correctly with fake timers?

### Event-driven code

- **Event ordering** — Are events emitted in the expected sequence?
- **Event payload** — Does each event contain the correct data?
- **Listener cleanup** — Are event listeners removed to prevent memory leaks?
- **Error in event handler** — Does an error in one handler prevent other handlers from running?

---

## Testing State Management

### What to verify in stores (Zustand, Redux, MobX, Vuex, etc.):

- **Initial state** — Does the store start with the correct default values?
- **Actions/mutations** — Does each action produce the expected state change?
- **Selectors/getters** — Do derived values compute correctly?
- **Subscription notifications** — Are subscribers notified on change?
- **State boundaries** — What happens at min/max values? Does a counter go below 0? Does a list exceed its max size?
- **Concurrent updates** — If two actions fire simultaneously, is the final state correct?
- **Reset** — If the store supports reset, does it return to initial state completely?
- **Persistence** — If state is persisted (localStorage, disk), does save/load round-trip correctly?

---

## Testing File System Operations

- **Always use temp directories** — Create a temp dir in beforeEach, delete it in afterEach
- **Test with different file contents:** empty files, very large files, binary files, files with unicode names
- **Test permissions:** read-only files, non-existent files, non-existent parent directories
- **Test paths:** relative vs absolute, paths with spaces, paths with special characters, symlinks
- **Test concurrent access:** what happens if two operations read/write the same file?
- **On Windows vs Unix:** path separators, line endings, case sensitivity

---

## Testing Network/API Calls

- **Mock at the HTTP level** — Use `msw` (Mock Service Worker), `nock`, or framework-provided mocks. Don't mock your own HTTP client wrapper.
- **Test all HTTP methods** — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH if used
- **Test response codes:** 200 (success), 201 (created), 400 (bad request), 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 429 (rate limited), 500 (server error), 503 (service unavailable)
- **Test request format:** correct headers, correct body serialization, correct query parameters
- **Test timeout behavior:** what happens when the server doesn't respond?
- **Test retry logic:** does the client retry on 5xx? Does it respect Retry-After headers?
- **Test pagination:** does the client handle paginated responses correctly?
- **Test rate limiting:** does the client back off when rate limited?

---

## Test Quality Principles

- **Test behavior, not implementation** — Assert on outputs and side effects, not internal state. If you refactor the internals, tests should still pass.
- **One assertion concept per test** — Each test should verify one logical thing (may use multiple `expect` calls for one concept, e.g., checking both status code and body of a response is ONE concept).
- **Descriptive test names** — The test name should be a specification. Reading all test names should tell you what the module does.
  - Bad: `it("works")`, `it("test error")`, `it("should handle case")`
  - Good: `it("returns 404 when user not found")`, `it("retries 3 times on network timeout")`, `it("truncates message to 280 characters when over limit")`
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** — Clear separation. Setup is obvious. The action being tested is one line. Assertions verify the outcome.
- **No test interdependence** — Each test must pass in isolation and in any order. Use beforeEach for fresh state.
- **Minimal mocking** — Only mock what you MUST mock (external services, time, randomness, filesystem in unit tests). The more you mock, the less your test proves.
- **Deterministic** — Run the test 1000 times, get the same result. No flakiness.
- **Fast** — Unit tests should complete in milliseconds. If a test takes seconds, you're probably doing I/O you should mock.
- **Readable** — A test is documentation. Someone unfamiliar with the codebase should understand what the module does by reading the tests.

| Signal | Framework | Run Command | Coverage Command |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `vitest` in package.json | Vitest | `npx vitest run` | `npx vitest --coverage` |
| `jest` in package.json | Jest | `npx jest` | `npx jest --coverage` |
| `@testing-library/*` | RTL (with Jest/Vitest) | Same as above | Same as above |

| `ava` in package.json | AVA | `npx ava` | `npx c8 ava` |
| `pytest` in requirements/pyproject | pytest | `pytest` | `pytest --cov` |
| `unittest` imports | Python unittest | `python -m pytest` | `pytest --cov` |
| `_test.go` files | Go testing | `go test ./...` | `go test -cover ./...` |

| `*_test.dart` | Flutter test | `flutter test` | `flutter test --coverage` |

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Testing implementation, not behavior** — Don't assert on internal variable values. Assert on what the function returns or what side effects it causes. If you refactor internals, tests shouldn't break.
- **Duplicating implementation logic in tests** — If your test just repeats the production logic to compute the expected value, you're testing nothing. Use hardcoded expected values.
- **Mocking everything** — If you mock the database, the API client, the filesystem, and the logger, what are you actually testing? Just the glue code. Use integration tests with real dependencies for critical paths.
- **Generating trivial tests for coverage** — 100 tests asserting that getters return the value they were set to proves nothing. Focus on behavior with meaningful inputs.
- **Not running tests after writing them** — ALWAYS run your tests. A test that doesn't pass is worse than no test (it gives false confidence or blocks CI).
- **Testing library/framework behavior** — Don't test that `Array.map` works or that `express.Router` routes correctly. Trust your dependencies.
- **Writing flaky tests** — If a test sometimes passes and sometimes fails, it's worse than no test. Fix the non-determinism or delete the test.
- **Snapshot testing overuse** — Snapshots are useful for catching unintended changes in complex output (ANSI terminal output, HTML rendering). They are NOT useful for testing logic. If a snapshot breaks, the developer should understand WHY, not just update it blindly.
- **Ignoring test maintenance** — If you add a new parameter to a function, update ALL existing tests that call it. Don't leave tests that pass by coincidence because of default parameter values.
- **Testing private methods directly** — If you need to test a private method, either: (a) test it through the public API, or (b) it's doing enough to warrant being extracted into its own module with its own public API.
- **Copy-paste test duplication** — If you're copying the same test body with minor variations, use parameterized tests (test.each in Jest/Vitest, @pytest.mark.parametrize in pytest, table-driven tests in Go).

---

## What "Good Coverage" Means

Coverage is NOT just a percentage. Here's what to aim for:

- **Line coverage** — What percentage of lines were executed during tests. Aim: 80%+ for critical modules, 60%+ overall. But 100% line coverage does NOT mean no bugs.
- **Branch coverage** — Were both sides of every if/else executed? This is MORE important than line coverage. A function with 100% line coverage but 50% branch coverage has untested logic paths.
- **Function coverage** — Were all functions called at least once? Any function with 0% coverage is a gap.
- **What coverage DOESN'T tell you:**
  - Whether the assertions are correct (code can be executed without being verified)
  - Whether edge cases are covered (line coverage says "this line ran" not "this line ran with all important inputs")
  - Whether integration between modules works
  - Whether the tests are deterministic and reliable

---

## Handling Common Testing Challenges

### The function is too complex to test
- **Solution:** This is a design smell. The function probably does too many things. Suggest refactoring: extract pure logic into testable helper functions. Test those. Integration-test the orchestrating function at a higher level.

### External dependencies make testing hard
- **Solution:** Use dependency injection. Pass dependencies as parameters instead of importing them directly. In tests, pass mocks. In production, pass real implementations.

### The test requires complex setup
- **Solution:** Create factory functions or fixtures. `createTestUser({ admin: true })` is clearer than 20 lines of manual object construction in every test.

### Tests are slow
- **Solution:** Slow tests are usually doing real I/O. Mock it for unit tests. Keep integration tests (with real I/O) in a separate suite that runs less frequently.

### Can't test without running the whole app
- **Solution:** The module is too tightly coupled. Extract the logic you want to test into a pure function that takes inputs and returns outputs. Wire it up to the app separately.
